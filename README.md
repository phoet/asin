[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/phoet/asin.png)](http://travis-ci.org/phoet/asin)

ASIN is a simple, extensible wrapper for parts of the REST-API of Amazon Product Advertising API (aka Associates Web Service aka Amazon E-Commerce Service).

For more information on the REST calls, have a look at the whole [Amazon E-Commerce-API](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/index.html).

Have a look at the [RDOC](http://rdoc.info/projects/phoet/asin) for this project, if you like browsing some docs.

The gem runs smoothly with Rails 3 and is tested against multiple rubies. See *.travis.yml* for details.

## Installation

    gem install asin
    gem install httpclient # optional, see HTTPI

or in your Gemfile:

    gem 'asin'
    gem 'httpclient' # optional, see HTTPI

## Configuration

Rails style initializer (config/initializers/asin.rb):

    ASIN::Configuration.configure do |config|
      config.secret        = 'your-secret'
      config.key           = 'your-key'
      config.associate_tag = 'your-tag'
    end

Have a look at ASIN::Configuration class for all the details.

## Usage

ASIN is designed as a module, so you can include it into any object you like:

    # require and include
    require 'asin'
    include ASIN::Client
    
    # lookup an ASIN
    lookup '1430218150'

    # lookup multiple items by ASIN
    lookup ['1430218150','1934356549']

But you can also use the *instance* method to get a proxy-object:

    # just require
    require 'asin'
    
    # create an ASIN client
    client = ASIN::Client.instance
    
    # lookup an item with the amazon standard identification number (asin)
    items = client.lookup '1430218150'
    
    # have a look at the title of the item
    items.first.title
    => Learn Objective-C on the Mac (Learn Series)
    
    # search for any kind of stuff on amazon with keywords
    items = search_keywords 'Learn', 'Objective-C'
    items.first.title
    => "Learn Objective-C on the Mac (Learn Series)"
    
    # search for any kind of stuff on amazon with custom parameters
    search :Keywords => 'Learn Objective-C', :SearchIndex => :Books
    items.first.title
    => "Learn Objective-C on the Mac (Learn Series)"
    
    # access the internal data representation (Hashie::Mash)
    item.raw.ItemAttributes.ListPrice.FormattedPrice
    => $39.99
    
    # search for similar items like the one you already have
    items = client.similar '1430218150'

There is an additional set of methods to support AWS cart operations:

    client = ASIN::Client.instance
    
    # create a cart with an item
    cart = client.create_cart({:asin => '1430218150', :quantity => 1})
    cart.items
    => [<#Hashie::Mash ASIN="1430218150" CartItemId="U3G241HVLLB8N6" ... >]
    
    # get an already existing cart from a CartId and HMAC
    cart = client.get_cart('176-9182855-2326919', 'KgeVCA0YJTbuN/7Ibakrk/KnHWA=')
    cart.empty?
    => false
    
    # clear everything from the cart
    cart = client.clear_cart(cart)
    cart.empty?
    => true
    
    # add items to the cart
    cart = client.add_items(cart, {:asin => '1430216263', :quantity => 2})
    cart.empty?
    => false
    
    # update items in the cart
    cart = client.update_items(cart, {:cart_item_id => cart.items.first.CartItemId, :action => :SaveForLater}, {:cart_item_id => cart.items.first.CartItemId, :quantity => 7})
    cart.saved_items
    => [<#Hashie::Mash ASIN="1430218150" CartItemId="U3G241HVLLB8N6" ... >]

It's also possible to access browse nodes:

    client = ASIN::Client.instance
    
    # create a cart with an item
    node = client.browse_node('163357', :ResponseGroup => :TopSellers)
    node.node_id
    => '163357'
    node.name
    => 'Comedy'

## Response Configuration

ASIN is customizable in the way it returns Responses from Amazon.
By default it will return *SimpleItem*, *SimpleCart* or *SimpleNode* instances,
but you can override this behavior for using your custom Classes:

    client.configure :item_type => YourItemClass
    client.configure :cart_type => YourCartClass
    client.configure :node_type => YourNodeClass

You can also use built-in *:raw*, *:mash* types.
## HTTPI

ASIN uses [HTTPI](https://github.com/rubiii/httpi) as a HTTP-Client adapter.
See the HTTPI documentation for how to configure different clients or the logger.
As a default HTTPI uses _httpclient_ so you should add that dependency to your project:

    gem 'httpclient'

## Confiture

ASIN uses [Confiture](https://github.com/phoet/confiture) as a Configuration gem.
See the Confiture documentation for different configuration styles.
